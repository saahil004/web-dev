CORE WEB VITALS(they keep changing):
CLS > cumulative layout shift(page ka layout ya visible elements kitna shift horahe hain page load hote hote)
LCP > largest contentful paint(page ka sabse bara element kitni der mein load horaha hai. 2.5 ya less seconds acha lcp hai.)
FID > first input delay(kitni der mein ek input process horaha hai for example ek button click 100ms se kam mein hojaye tou best)
INP > interaction to next paint(button click ke baad dusri cheez kab load hogi aur responsiveness)

INP focuses on the time it takes from a user's interaction to the next paint (when the response from that interaction is processed and loaded on the screen). INP measures page responsiveness by analyzing quickly a user can see something happening after an interaction.
 
‍

FID, however, measures page responsiveness from when a user first interacts with your site (click a link, tap on a button, etc.) to when the browser can respond to that interaction. This could be impacted by other processes the browser is conducting simultaneously.
